description: This data set is composed of eight bilateral silicon-probe multi-cellular
  electrophysiological recordings performed on four male Long-Evans rats in the Buzsáki
  lab at NYU. These recordings were performed to assess the effect of novel spatial
  learning on hippocampal CA1 neural firing and LFP patterns in naïve animals. Each
  session consisted of a long (~4 hour) PRE rest/sleep epoch home-cage recordings
  performed in a familiar room, followed by a Novel MAZE running epoch (~45 minutes)
  in which the animals were transferred to a novel room, and water-rewarded to run
  on a novel maze. These mazes were either A) a wooden 1.6m linear platform, B) a
  wooden 1m diameter circular platform or C) a 2m metal linear platform. Animals were
  rewarded either at both ends of the linear platform, or at a predetermined location
  on the circular platform. The animal was gently encouraged to run unidirectionally
  on the circular platform. After the MAZE epochs the animals were transferred back
  to their home-cage in the familiar room where a long (~4 hour) POST rest/sleep was
  recorded. All eight sessions were concatenated from the PRE, MAZE, and POST recording
  epochs. In addition to hippocampal electrophysiological recordings, neck EMG and
  head-mounted accelerometer signals were recorded, and the animal’s position during
  MAZE running epochs was tracked via head-mounted LEDs.
